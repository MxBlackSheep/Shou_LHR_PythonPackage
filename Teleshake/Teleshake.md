# Teleshake

## Legacy Teleshake Helper Programme (RS232send.py)

- This file is modified from the old C version to Python. It manually introduces additional waiting time to accomodate the communication delay between VM and teleshake.
- It does NOT calculate parameters to be used; it is called by the VENUS Teleshake Sub-method library.

## New Un-tested Programme (RS232send_New.py)

- This file is derived from the legacy Helper Programme and VENUS Teleshake Sub-method library.
- Could live on it own; if worked then could replace the VENUS code with one line of executing this programme.
